    "This data can be useful in identifying trends in poisonous mushrooms and assist in the classification of unknown mushrooms.\n",

    "From the dataset's description: \"This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like \"leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "According to http://www.amjbot.org/content/98/3/426.full, TODO cite there are estimated to be upwards of 5 million species of fungi, with only around 100,000 of them having been discovered and documented. At estimated discovery rates of 1200 species per year, scientists estimate it could take as long as 4000 years to discover all species of fungi. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that only the tip of the iceberg has been studied as far as fungi is concerned. The dataset mentions that \"shrooming\" is experiencing a boom in popularity. With such a low percentage of documented fungi, it's possible that someone walking through a forest could happen upon a species of mushroom that's never been seen. People are curious, and someone is bound to want to try eating this strange mushroom. \n",
